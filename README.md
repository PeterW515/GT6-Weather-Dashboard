# GT6-Weather-Dashboard
This web app allows a user to search for a city and view the current and future weather conditions. Recently searched cities are saved in a list so a user can quickly switch between cities. The data for current weather and a five day forecast is presented in an easy-to-read manner with color coding for UV index.
